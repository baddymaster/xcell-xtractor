xcell-xtractor
==============

A short python script to extract specific pieces of an information given in the form of an Excel file and write those in the same format in another Excel file.

This script utilises the following python modules : 
1. xlrd (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd)
2. xlwt (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt)
 
For modifying the existing file instead creating a new one, use :
